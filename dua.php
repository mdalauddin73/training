["Allah (Alone) is Sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs (for us)".]</br></br>

We should not forget that Allah swt. watches over everything. His sovereignty is far greater than we can ever imagine, and his domain has no limits. His intellect is infinite and surely Allah swt. - The King of Kings - Is sufficient..</p>
